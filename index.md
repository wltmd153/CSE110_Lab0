**with my wonderful team, I am looking forward for an early access of the game through steam**

My favorite lines of codes would be

```
Input.getMouseDown(0)
while(true)
break
```
Also I am looking forward to attend to the Independent game festival which can be found with more info on

In my team I am doing following jobs
- General Programming
- Finding Sound sources
- Allocating 
- Data science

And the amount of work by rank would be
1. General Programming
2. Data Science
3. Allocating
4. translation
5. Finding Sound sources
